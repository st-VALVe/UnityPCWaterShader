# UnityPCWaterShader
This project was a test task for Unity technical artist role.
#### "Task: You are given a terrain mesh with an empty hole. The goal is to create a scene in Unity using that terrain, where clicking inside the hole will fill that hole with water".

The return period was only 24 hours.
So not all code was written from scratch. Most of hlsl function libraries have been reused from my previous game projects.

This water shader supports:
1. underwater caustics
2. subsurface scattering
3. sun specular effect
4. surface planar reflections
5. underwater refraction
6. shallow water off the coast
7. Vertex deformation of the Gerstner wave

This project was built in Unity 2020.3.18f1
