# UnityPCWaterShader
This project was a test task for Unity technical artist role.
"Task: You are given a terrain mesh with an empty hole. The goal is to create a scene in Unity using that terrain, where clicking inside the hole will fill that hole with water".

The return period was only 24h.
So not all of the code was written from scratch. Some hlsl function libraries was reused from my previous projects.

This water shader supports:
1. underwater caustics
2. subsurface scattering
3. sun specular effect
4. surface planar reflections
5. underwater refractions
6. shoal water near coasts
7. Gerster wave vertex deformation

This project was built in Unity 2020.3.18f1
